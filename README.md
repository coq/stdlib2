The purpose of this project is to design and implement a new standard library
for Coq. It will follow a clean slate approach, not aiming at compatibility with
the current library, which will be maintained separately.

## Organization

This project is coordinated by @maximedenes and can be discussed and followed
at: https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7711 and
https://github.com/orgs/coq/projects/1

We foresee several stages:
 1. Preliminary clean-up and infrastructure work
 1. Implementation of prelude and basic tactics
 1. Enhancement of the core of the library.
 1. First release.
 1. Implementation of the first components of the library
 1. Extensions of the library

## Current status

The project is currently (February 2019) in its second phase (starting the
actual implementation).

Questions and discussions are welcome at this stage. In particular, the wiki and
issues (as opposed to code reviews) can be used to share and discuss opinions.

External code contribution will be integrated during the last two phases. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](contributing guide)
